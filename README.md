# meek-mock

A presentation on functional music using [pink][4] and [score][5], 
with a few interactive goodies, including a pattern sequencer.

You'll need to install boot - the original. And this *needs* java 1.7 for the sound magic to happen.

## Dependencies

- java 1.7+
- [boot][1]
- [leiningen][2]

## Usage

1. Start the auto-compiler. In a terminal:

    ```bash
    $ boot development
    ```

2. Go to [http://localhost:8000][3] in your browser. 
Flip through the presentation using the arrow keys.
